# Hey guys Ayaan here, and welcome to web review.

(Nextjs,core-js,flutter< swift+kotlin,firebase,s3,node.js (special para :styled-components)
Unfortunately I was unable to find the exact tech stack that CRED utilises, so after a lot of interpolation and research I think I have come pretty close.

## This week we are going to take a look at CRED's website!

Lets mix up things this time and analyse the website the way god intended, that is straight from the top

- ### Frontend

  1. ### <ins>Website</ins> ->

     From what I have gathered from job positions, interviews and other sources the website is built using NextJS along with CoreJS that is primarily styled utilising styled components.

     The website itself is a bit dissapointing, there are several components which I feel are not optimised such as the animations of the phones arising once a user scrolls past it, another instance of the desktop version of the website being a bit tricky to handle is the animations of the text that appear along with the phone.
     I am unaware if it was a design choice to emphasize the `CRED` keyword, but keeping every letter even the begining of sentences as non capitalized was a bit jarring to say the least.

     As I have said in my previous article, NextJS is an all round generally good choice in frontend development, (`My own website itself is built on NextJS and the only issue I really faced was when I tried to webview a local PDF file and couldnt because of server side rendering`).

     I have personally not used `Core-JS` to a large extent but I can see its uses, especially for introducing object-oriented and event-driven JavaScript code.I delved deep enough into it, that I am seriously considering using it for my own site.

     `Styled-components` has been a personal favorite of mine whenever I was tasked with utilising the least amount of resources while getting the maximum potential styling.One issue I did face with it is that as we scale the application further, I found that the alternative styling libraries simply offered far more design capabilitie

  2. ### <ins>Mobile</ins> ->

     I've decided to combine the iOS and Android components as we can righly assume that most of these companies would use the same languages and frameworks that are preset, unfortunately the `mobile programming market is dominated by certain players` in their respective fields.

     Rather I would like to concentrate on the ways certain companies differ from one another ranging from different analytical tools and inhouse methods solve difficult solutions to the process of migration to a different tech stack.

     For example, during my research I can safely say that `CRED` may be moving to `flutter`, I have been enamoured by flutter recently and I cant get it out of my head. It is extremely easy to use and has extensive documentation as well as a vibrant community.
     The best part? Its platform independent so there is no reason to get double the work force to cater to people beyond the other side. Although being built
