# Lets get familiar with these frameworks!

The ever-present dilemma of choosing a framework arises in every person’s mind whether it is an entrepreneur or a hobbyist or even a company meaning to improve their tech stack. The three titans of javascript frameworks are `ReactJS, AngularJS and NextJS` with their legions of supporters it is often hard for beginners to get a grasp of the whole scenario.

## ReactJS

- Let's start off with ReactJS, the beloved darling of the majority of web developers owing to the ability to make simple component trees. Do not be mistaken though, `React is technically not even a framework it is simply a large library` that lacks a model and a controller which was resolved by Facebook introducing Flux.

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| DOM              | **Virtual DOM**                                   |
| App Architecture | **Flux**                                          |
| Performance      | **Faster**                                        |
| Usage            | **Single page, but for multiple views at a time** |
| Data Binding     | **Uni-Directional**                               |
| Rendering        | **Server-Side**                                   |

Considering that Angular is around 3 years younger than React and Vue is a year older,`It appears that the old adage of the middle child always being successful came true in this case. `

My view on the matter? React is perfect for beginners as it is comparatively easy to gain experience via internships using it and is generally a good stepping off point for everyone. But do not treat it as the end, rather treat it as the beginning. If you are strictly looking for a framework using ReactJS, I suggest you look up NextJS.

## AngularJS

- Now we turn towards AngularJS, currently maintained by Google, it is mainly based on HTML, and Javascript and is mainly used for Single Page Application. `It works by essentially extending HTML components as well as binding data to HTML scripts.`

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| DOM              | **Virtual DOM**                                   |
| App Architecture | **Flux**                                          |
| Performance      | **Faster**                                        |
| Usage            | **Single page, but for multiple views at a time** |
| Data Binding     | **Uni-Directional**                               |
| Rendering        | **Server-Side**                                   |

Angular is a tried and true framework which is still used to a large extent, but it is used for more specific demands where the `number of resources being utilised must be reduced`, as `traffic itself is low `so that we do not unnecessarily use resources. (i.e minimalist web pages).

## VueJS

- Finally, we face VueJS, the runt of the litter but just because it is younger and not more popular doesn't mean that it is equally important. VueJS takes the best of both angular and react while maintaining.

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| DOM              | **Virtual DOM**                                   |
| App Architecture | **Flux**                                          |
| Performance      | **Faster**                                        |
| Usage            | **Single page, but for multiple views at a time** |
| Data Binding     | **Uni-Directional**                               |
| Rendering        | **Server-Side**                                   |

It follows angular’s method of extending HTML with HTML attributes called derivative.Vuejs has three types of binding:- 1. One Way binding 2. Two Way binding 3. Loop binding

Due to its relative obscurity, many beginners would dismiss this framework, I personally would not fall into this trap, and rather focus on this along with React. `Simply because no one can predict the future development processes, and due to the large variety of features as well as being lightweight can lead to a potential surge in demand for this framework.`

# To Conclude

- I would suggest beginners to begin with ReactJS and then either choose AngularJS or VueJS, if I were to choose one of them I would prefer Vue over Angular simply because of the extra features and large potential for growth
