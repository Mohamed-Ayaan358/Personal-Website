Hi there!

My name is Mohamed Ayaan and welcome to my little corner of the net! I'm currently a 3rd year Btech student at PES University.This website is where I hope to express my intrests in web development as well as computer research.

Also do keep waiting for new blog posts that will be arriving anytime soon !

This website is based on [Timothy Lins](https://github.com/timlrx)'s NextJS Tailwind template with my own flavour included in it.
